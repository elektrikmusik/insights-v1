# Vibe Step 5: Build MVP

Execute the development loop to build the MVP according to the defined specifications.

## The Vibe Loop
1. **Plan**: Agent proposes an approach for the next feature.
2. **Execute**: Agent implements the feature.
3. **Verify**: Agent (or user) verifies the feature works (automated tests or manual check).

## Workflow

1. **Initial Context**:
   - Read `AGENTS.md` to identify the "Current Phase" and the next task.
   - Refer to `agent_docs/` for specific patterns and constraints.

2. **Incremental Execution**:
   - Follow the roadmap in `AGENTS.md`.
   - Update `AGENTS.md` (Recently Completed / Working On) after each milestone.

3. **Status Check**: Use `/vibe-status` (informal recommendation) to see progress vs the roadmap.

## Final Success Definition
The MVP is complete when the "Success Checklist" in the Tech Design is fully checked off.
