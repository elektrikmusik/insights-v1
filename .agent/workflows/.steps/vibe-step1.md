# Vibe Step 1: Deep Research

This step analyzes market opportunity, competitors, and technical feasibility for your app idea.

## Workflow

1. **Self-Identification**: Ask the user if they are a:
   - A) **Vibe-coder** (Great ideas, limited experience)
   - B) **Developer** (Experienced programmer)
   - C) **In between** (Some basics)

2. **Interview**: Follow the appropriate question path from the research template:
   - Ask questions **one at a time**.
   - For Vibe-coders: Goal, target users, existing solutions, "special sauce", top 3 features, platform, timeline, budget.
   - For Developers: Main topic, specific questions, technical decisions, scope, depth needed, prioritized sources, constraints, business context.

3. **Verification Echo**: Summarize the project back to the user (Project, Target Users, Problem, Key Features, Platform, Timeline, Budget).

4. **Generate Research Request**: After confirmation, generate a "Deep Research Request" prompt tailored to their level.

5. **Completion**:
   - Save the generated research request to `docs/research-request.md`.
   - Instructions for user: Copy this prompt into a search-enabled AI (like Gemini 2.0 or Claude with Search) to get up-to-date data.
   - Save results to `docs/research-[AppName].txt`.
