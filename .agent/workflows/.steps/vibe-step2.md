# Vibe Step 2: PRD (Product Requirements Document)

Transforms your idea into clear, actionable product specifications.

## Prerequisites
- Completed research from `/vibe-step1` (found in `docs/research-[AppName].txt`).

## Workflow

1. **Information Gathering**:
   - Scan any available research file in `docs/`.
   - Ask the user for their technical level if not already known.
   - Ask initial questions: Product Name, Problem Statement, Launch Goal.

2. **Persona & Journey**: Follow the path-specific questions (Vibe-coder vs Developer vs In-between) to define:
   - Target audience & pain points.
   - User journey stories.
   - Must-have vs Should-have features (MoSCoW).
   - Success metrics.
   - Design "vibe".

3. **Verification Echo**: Summarize the product definition back to the user.

4. **Generate PRD**: Create the full PRD document using the appropriate template.

5. **Completion**:
   - Save the PRD to `docs/PRD-[YourAppName]-MVP.md`.

## Next Step
Once the PRD is ready:
`/vibe-step3`
