# Vibe Step 3: Technical Design

Decides the best tech stack and implementation approach for your MVP.

## Prerequisites
- Approved PRD from `/vibe-step2` (in `docs/PRD-[AppName]-MVP.md`).

## Workflow

1. **Information Gathering**:
   - Read the PRD from `docs/`.
   - Ask level-specific technical questions (one at a time):
     - Platform (Web/Mobile/Desktop).
     - Budget & Timeline constraints.
     - Preferred stack (if any).
     - Scale/Complexity expectations.

2. **Verification Echo**: Summarize technical requirements (Platform, Approach, Costs, Timeline, Concerns).

3. **Generate Design**: Create the Technical Design Document.
   - Provide alternatives with pros/cons.
   - Justify the primary recommendation.
   - Include database schema (Mermaid or SQL).
   - Outline feature-by-feature implementation logic.

4. **Completion**:
   - Save the results to `docs/TechDesign-[YourAppName]-MVP.md`.

## Next Step
Once tech design is finalized:
